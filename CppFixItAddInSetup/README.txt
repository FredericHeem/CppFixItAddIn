CppFixItAddIn is a visual studio add-in for performing C++ static analysis.
It statically analyzes C++ code from either a file, a project or a solution.
No configuration required, information about the defines and include are extracted from the visual studio c++ project. 

The Clang c++ static analyzer is used as the backend.
